## Introduction

Welcome to the D.T developer documentation. The heart of Disciple Tools as an open source project is to empower ministries and disciple makers to move at the pace of God's vision for them. Technology can help only if it can be made to serve the vision.

Our ambition is to build disciple making software that unleashes your obedience to the vision He gave you.
