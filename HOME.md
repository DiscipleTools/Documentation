# Disciple.Tools Technical Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the D.T developer documentation. The heart of Disciple Tools as an open source project is to empower ministries and disciple makers to move at the pace of God's vision for them. Technology can help only if it can be made to serve the vision.

Our ambition is to build disciple making software that unleashes your obedience to the vision He gave you.

Follow the side navigation to find documentation for Hosting, Disciple.Tools Theme Development, Getting Setup Locally and more.

Thank you for joining us in contributing to Disciple.Tools!

## Theme Contribution

The theme is the core of Disciple.Tools. It holds the default features and configuration of D.T and everything else is build around it.

The theme is hosted on GitHub [here](https://github.com/DiscipleTools/disciple-tools-theme).

If you are interested in contributing to the theme a good place to start would be to browse our [“Help Wanted”](https://github.com/DiscipleTools/disciple-tools-theme/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) issues.

Clone the Repo and submit a Pull Request when your feature is ready. See the [helpful instructions](code-contribution/from-fork-to-pull-request.md). Be sure to follow the [contribution guidelines](code-contribution/contribution-guidelines.md).

[Here](local-setup/) is documentation for getting set up in your development environment set up.

## Plugin Contribution

All our plugins are open source, you can see a list of them [here](https://disciple.tools/plugins/)

Use the same instructions for the Theme to Fork and Contribute to a plugin

## Create Your Own Plugin

The [D.T Starter Plugin](https://github.com/DiscipleTools/disciple-tools-plugin-starter-template) sets the structure for what a D.T plugin should look like and comes with useful examples to get started with.

We encourage you to check it out and start developing from there.
