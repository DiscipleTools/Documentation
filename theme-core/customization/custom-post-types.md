# Custom Post Types

Contacts and Groups are post types. With custom post types you can add a post type gaining:

* a menu tab next to metrics
* a menu option to create records
* a list page
* a details page.
* a set of endpoints ready to use.
* some cool to show your friends.

To create a custom post type see our "starters" plugin: [https://github.com/DiscipleTools/disciple-tools-plugin-starter-template](https://github.com/DiscipleTools/disciple-tools-plugin-starter-template)
