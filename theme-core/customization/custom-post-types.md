# Custom Post Types

Contacts and Groups are post types. With custom post types you can add a post type gaining:

- a menu tab next to metrics
- a menu option to create records
- a list page
- a details page.
- a set of endpoints ready to use.
- some cool to show your friends.

To create a custom post type copy our "clusters" example or replace all occurrences of "clusters" with the word of your choice.
